# mitchDebianScript

This bash script:

* Installs programs I use frequently
* Clones and compiles [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) from source since it is not currently available through the Debian apt repositories.  
* Clones my dotfiles and moves them to the correct directories

I plan to update the script to detect the distribution and alter the apt-get commands such that it is compatible with Linux Mint and Ubuntu as well.
