# Debian-Setup-Script

This bash script configures a new Debian installation with all the programs and configuration files I need.  

It clones and compiles [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) from source since it is not currently available through in the debian apt repository.  

I plan to update the script to detect the distribution and alter the apt-get commands such that it is compatible with Linux Mint and Ubuntu as well
