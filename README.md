# Mitchell's Debian Setup Script

I wrote this script to help me get up and running whenever I get a new machine.

This bash script:

* Installs the programs I use frequently
* Clones and compiles [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) from source since it is not currently available through the Debian apt repositories.  
* Clones my dotfiles and moves them to the correct directories

TODO:
 * Need error checking
 * Could potentially expand script to be distro agnostic and work with Manjaro too
