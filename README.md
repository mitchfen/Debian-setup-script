# mitchDebianScript

This bash script:

* Installs programs I use frequently
* Clones and compiles [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) from source since it is not currently available through the Debian apt repositories.  
* Clones my dotfiles and moves them to the correct directories

TODO:
 * Need to do error checking and be able to deal with failures
 * Need mechanism to detect Debian derivatives and make appropriate changes
 * Could potentially change script to be distro agnostic and work with Manjaro too
